Bro, this story is not an ordinary one.

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:07.420
It's a narrative inspired by a real incident.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.390
What's your background, man?

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.399
Weren't you in the movie 'Kobbaribondam'?

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.219
[vocables]

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.779
Did you watch the film Baahubali?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.049
Do you know the individual standing in the seventh position within the sixth row?

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:52.130
you should stay with us

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.950
I am a... Junior artist!

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.380
Hey, you're just a junior artist, I mean an extra.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.489
Is it necessary for someone as ordinary as you to show off?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.489
Try to blend the words rather than saying them separately, dad.

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.769
Extra-Ordinary!

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.000
My son!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Garbage!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Useless guy!
